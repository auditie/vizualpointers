        summary: 'From design to development, a look at how I built the vizualpointers site!',
        content: 'To start with the site I worked with Figma to work on a design to build from. I created a color palette and spent a lot of time looking through other designs to find a look I was going for. I ended up going for a somewhat "editorial" style and ended up really liking that. The color pallete is pulled from colors that are frequently in my photography style for the dogs. I think I ended up making 3 different versions of the site... it was so hard to pick because I constantly kept thinking of different ideas or looks I could do. But I finally settled on this design!<br /><br />Once I had the design I started building the site. I have mainly used React for building websites in the past, but I had started using Next.js at work. I wanted to build this site with Next.js to improve my knowledge and skills for my own job. It\'s challenging sometimes building something at work with a new technology/language, so I thought when there\'s a different motivation like building it for myself it would help! Building this site was a huge learning experience for me, but I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot more about React + Next.js and have been able to apply that to my work. I\'m really happy with how it turned out and I\'m excited to continue to work on it and improve it over time!<br/><br/>If you ever have questions about coding or wanna talk about web development feel free to reach out! I\'m always happy to chat about it!',
        intro: 'My full-time job besides being a dog mom is a software engineer. I have always wanted to build a website for the dogs and I finally got around to it! I wanted to build a site that was easy to navigate and had a clean design. I also wanted to make sure it was mobile responsive since most people are on their phones these days. I decided to use Next.js for the front end, which was a huge learning experience since I\'m still fairly new to it. My college degree is actually in Advertising with an Art Direciton emphasis, so I am pretty picky about design and new I wanted to do it myself. I\'ve always been hard on myself as a designer, and it took me a looong time to stick with a final design for this site. Surprisingly designing it took me much longer than building it. But I\'m really happy with it and I\'m sure I\'ll continue to tweak the look and design many more times lol. It\'s been a really fun passion project!',

        title: 'Belton FastCAT',

        summary: 'Our first FastCat event in Belton, TX.',
        content: 'The fastCAT event was held by the Bearded Collie Club of Texas. We were able to run both Friday and Saturday. Since it was our first time I was pretty anxious! They require you to check in a little bit before your first run. This is to make sure every dog looks physically fit and capable to run, and they also make sure no females are in heat. After the examination you\'re able to get your number and wait for your turn to run. Before we got in line I took Peach near the middle of the straight on the outside of the run to show Peach the bag/lure going down and back. She was immediately curious about the lure zipping down the run. She\'s already a very vocal dog and this made her very loud haha. I wanted to show her the lure since she can get anxious at times and I didn\'t want her to be scared of it once she started her first run.<br /><br />We went to the line to wait for her turn. The closer we got, the louder she got. Linden wasn\'t able to come for Friday so luckily we had our friend Zenalla to catch Peach! She took off quick and ran through the whole straight to the end! But she was a little startled by Zenalla waiting at the end and tried to come back to me. Luckily the volunteers running the event were really nice and I was able to run along the side of the fence to get her back to the end for Zenalla to catch her.<br /><br />The rest of Peach\'s runs that weekend went really well! Linden was able to catch her on Saturday and she ended up getting a personal best of 8.2 seconds! Not bad for her first ever time. She probably only needs about 2-3 good runs of 25 mph to get her first title BCAT!<br /><br />Since Billy isn\'t a year old he wasn\'t able to compete or get an offical time. But at the end of the event they had Try-its which I highly recommend if you are new to fastCAT! It was a great opportunity to expose him to it for his first time. He even ran an 8.5! I was so impressed with him, especially since he ran all the way through the end and didn\'t slow down. I\'m really excited for him to be able to compete and work towards his first FastCAT title once he is older! <br /><br />Overall it was a really fun weekend and we were also excited to see our Austin friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/txtraildogs/" target="_blank">TX Trail Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/georgethetxpointer/" target="_blank">George the TX Pointer</a>! Cayden of TX Trail Dogs was photographing the event and took some great photos of Peach and Billy running!<br/><br/> We\'re running again in a few weeks on Memorial Day and can\'t wait!',
        intro: 'We have been dying to get the dogs into fastCAT for a long time now. Especially since the season is coming to an end soon. We finally took the time to take them to Belton, TX for their first FastCAT event. We were so excited to see how they would do and if they would enjoy it. They both did not dissapoint!',

        summary: 'GSPCA National Specialty Event in Peoria, IL.',
        content: 'This year the show was in Peoria, IL. Dog dad was unable to come due to work so Billy and I hopped in the car and drove 12 hours from Dallas to Peoria! We got there Sunday afternoon and stayed until Friday afternoon. The hotel had a convention center where they hosted the event. I had never seen so many spotty dogs in one place. There were GSPs of all ages from puppies to 14 years old!<br /><br />We showed Monday through Friday in Amatuer Owner Handled(AOH), Futurity, and Sweepstakes. One of the biggest reasons for going was for Futurity, which is "a non-regular competition where the breeder nominates a litter within 8 weeks of whelping. The idea is these dogs will represent that breeder\s best efforts in planning their highest quality litter for that year, based upon their knoweldge, understanding and confidence of the genetic potential of the proposed breeding." (<a href="https://www.gspca.org/events/futurity-show/" target="_blank">GSPCA</a>)<br /><br />We started off the week by showing in AOH Monday and Tuesday. We were able to place 1st both days in our class! We moved on to compete for Winners Dog but didn\'t place. We then showed in Sweepstakes on Wednesday and Futurity on Thursday. We didn\'t place in either but it was great because Billy\'s brother Kreacher placed 4th in Futurity! To wrap up the week we showed in AOH again on Friday. This time we ended up taking 2nd place. <br/><br/>It was a really fun week and I learned a lot. In the two other conformation shows we\'ve done it\'s been much smaller groups. So it was exciting to compete against a lot of GSPs. I got a couple of really nice compliments from judges saying Billy was "very well trained" and moved at the perfect pace in his gait around the ring. I was really proud of him and how well he showed. I\'m excited to continue showing him and see how he does in the future!<br/><br/><strong>Interstellar Fam Shoutouts</strong><br/>- Billy\'s mom Jemi took 2nd place Brood Bitch<br/>- Kreacher took 2nd place in Bred By Puppy & 4th place Futurity<br/>- JJ placed with his junior handler in all three shows<br/>- Jackson took 2nd in his puppy class on Monday and 4th in his class on Tuesday',
        intro: 'If you told me a year ago if I\'d be showing dogs, let alone at a National Speciality show, I wouldn\'t have believed you. A year ago I had never even been to a dog show! But when we started talking to Billy\'s breeder, Lexie, I was open to the idea. His mom was in the top 25 GSPs the following year and he comes from strong show lines. I was excited about the idea and wanted to give the show ring a try. I had no idea our third ever show would be at Nationals!',
